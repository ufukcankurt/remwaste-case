A modern React application for selecting skip sizes, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and a fully responsive, themeable UI.  
Designed for a seamless user experience with stepper navigation, skip cards, summary panel, and dark/light mode toggle.

---

## üß© Approach & Solution Overview

- **Mobile-first & Responsive:** UI was built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring seamless experience across all devices using Tailwind CSS utilities and custom SCSS modules where needed.
- **Component-based Architecture:** Stepper, SkipCard, SummaryCard, and ThemeToggleButton are modular and reusable, making the codebase maintainable and extensible.
- **Stepper Navigation:** Stepper configuration and icons are abstracted into a config file, allowing easy updates and clear separation of concerns.
- **Theme Support:** ThemeContext and CSS variables provide robust dark/light mode support, with system preference detection and local storage persistence.
- **API Integration:** Axios is used for data fetching, with loading states and error handling for optimal UX.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA roles and color contrast are considered for inclusive design.
- **Modern UX Details:** Animated selection, hover effects, sticky summary, and smooth transitions enhance the user experience.
